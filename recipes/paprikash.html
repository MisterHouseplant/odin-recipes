        <h2>Chicken paprikash, or paprika chicken is a popular dish of Hungarian origin.</h2>
        <p>This traditional Hungarian dish is made with browned chicken that is braised in a velvety rich and creamy paprika sauce and served with Hungarian dumplings called nokedli, but wide egg noddles can be used as an easy swap. The secret to making a flavorful sauce is to use authentic Hungarian sweet paprika which has the best flavor.</p>
