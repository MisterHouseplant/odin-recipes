        <h2>Chicken paprikash, or paprika chicken is a popular dish of Hungarian origin.</h2>
        <p>This traditional Hungarian dish is made with browned chicken that is braised in a velvety rich and creamy paprika sauce and served with Hungarian dumplings called nokedli, but wide egg noddles can be used as an easy swap. The secret to making a flavorful sauce is to use authentic Hungarian sweet paprika which has the best flavor.</p>

            <li>2 teaspoons kosher salt, divided</li>
            <li>1/2 cup all-purpose flour1/2 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>3-1/3 tablespoons Hungarian sweet paprika divided</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon black pepper divided</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>1 whole large sweet onion</li>
            <li>3 cloves garlic</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
            <li>2-3 cups chicken stock</li>
            <li>1/2 cup sour cream</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons chopped parsley</li>
        </ul>       

<h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat a heavy-bottomed brasier or deep-sided skillet over med-low heat.</li>
            <li>Pat chicken pieces dry with a paper towel and season both sides with about 1/2 teaspoon salt in total.</li>
            <li>Dredge chicken pieces in flour seasoned with 1/2 teaspoon of salt, 1/2 teaspoon of pepper, and 1 teaspoon of paprika. Shake off excess flour</li>
            <li>Add oil to the hot skillet then brown the chicken pieces on both sides, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer chicken to a plate and set aside.</li>
            <li>While the chicken is browning thinly slice the onion and mince the garlic.</li>
            <li>Add the onion slices to the pan and cook until they start to brown then stir in the minced garlic.</li>
            <li>Stir in the tomato paste then add 2 cups of chicken stock and scrape the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon.</li>
            <li>Stir in 3 tablespoons of paprika, 1 teaspoon of salt and 1/2 teaspoon of pepper.</li>
            <li>Add the chicken and its juices back to the pan. Cover the pan with the lid cracked and simmer on low heat for about 10-15 minutes until the chicken is cooked through.</li>
            <li>If the sauce seems too thick after simmering, stir in more chicken stock. The dumplings will soak up the sauce so it should be loose.</li>
            <li>Temper the sour cream by stirring in some of the sauce to prevent it from curdling</li>
            <li>Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the tempered sour cream. Stir in some of the minced parsley and reserve some for a garnish.</li>
            <li>Garnish with the rest of the parsley and serve right away over nokedli, egg noddles or rice.</li>
        </ol>
