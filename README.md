Recipe project.

The project is to build a page that links to 3 different recipe pages, utilizing the new skills of lists, images, links, and practicing html in general.

After finishing the project, I found that it was really good practice, and each recipe that I coded was easier than the last, and the syntax was easier to remember each time.

I'm excited to build on this and learn more complex coding, and how to make more aesthetically pleasing sites.
